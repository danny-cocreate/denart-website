## About The Experience

Through a unique blend of guided trance visualization, artistic body painting, and somatic embodiment practices, you'll physically step into your most empowered future self. This creative experience helps you embody the life you're actively creating and manifest your highest potential.

### The Process

- Initial consultation and intention setting (pre-session)
- Breathing exercise
- Guided somatic awareness exercises
- Future-self trance journey with guided visualization to embody your empowered self
- Creative exploration and symbol identification
- 2 hours of professional UV body painting bringing your future-self vision to life
- Documentation via photo and video (optional)
- Check-in calls between sessions (for multi-session packages)

### Inspired By

- **Viktor Frankl's Logotherapy:** Embodying meaning, purpose, and your future-directed narrative
- **Somatic Embodiment:** Physically inhabiting your empowered future-self state
- **Manifestation Practices:** Bringing your vision to tangible, visual life
- **Expressive Arts:** Creative body painting as a transformative ritual

## Who is This For?

This transformative experience is perfect for those who are:

- **Entrepreneurs & Leaders** — Building a powerful presence and embodying your next-level success
- **In Life Transition** — Turning 25, 30, 40, after a breakup/divorce, entering motherhood, or starting a new chapter—ready to see who you're becoming next
- **Manifestation Practitioners** — Taking your vision from mental to physical embodiment
- **Couples** — Sharing a transformative experience and stepping into your future together
- **Life Chapter Shifters** — Marking major milestones (i.e. finishing a degree or changing careers) with a powerful embodiment ritual

## Important Information

This is a creative experience using hypnotic visualization and body art, not psychotherapy or medical care. You are responsible for your wellbeing and integration. If you are working through intense emotions, please seek additional professional support. By booking, you acknowledge this session is art, not therapy.

## Multi-Session Packages

As your future self evolves, so does your embodiment practice. Multiple sessions allow you to explore different facets of your transformation and deepen your manifestation journey. Book multiple sessions upfront and save.
