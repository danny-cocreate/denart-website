## Celebrate motherhood with an artistic experience!

Pregnancy doesn't happen often, so take this time to cherish the natural beauty of motherhood and celebrate the joy of having a baby. We will help create a forever lasting bond between you and baby during this special time in your life with our body painting experience for expecting moms in their seventh or eighth month of pregnancy.

All our paints are water-based to protect you and baby from any chemical harm. We will cover your belly and upper torso and help create a design that is tailored to you and your body.
