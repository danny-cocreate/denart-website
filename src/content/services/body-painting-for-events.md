faqs:
  - question: "How far in advance should I book body painting for my event?"
    answer: "We recommend booking at least 2-4 weeks in advance to ensure availability. For larger events or custom designs, earlier is better. Last-minute bookings may be possible depending on our schedule."
  - question: "How long does body painting take at an event?"
    answer: "It depends on the setup. For roaming entertainment where painters work on models throughout your event, we can paint multiple guests over several hours. For a featured performance or demonstration, plan for 15-30 minutes per painted model."
  - question: "Do you provide the models?"
    answer: "Yes! We can provide professional models experienced in body painting. We also offer a workshop where guests can paint each other as a fun interactive activity."
  - question: "What types of events do you work with?"
    answer: "We've painted for corporate events, product launches, music albums, restaurant openings, fundraisers, private parties, fashion shows, and more. We're happy to discuss your specific needs."
  - question: "How do I prepare my venue for body painting?"
    answer: "We need a well-lit area with access to power for our lighting setup. We provide our own equipment, tables, and lighting. Just let us know the space available and we'll handle the rest."

## Make your event more engaging and memorable

Adding fine art body painting will add sexiness and sophistication to your event. Not only it will impress your guests, it will also make your guests want to talk about your event because it presents an opportunity for them to brag about their art history knowledge (i.e. "Last night at Ms. A's party I saw a Van Gogh piece painted on a live model!").

After painting the models, our painters can also paint your guests making your event even more memorable for them.

In addition to body painters, we can also provide [models](/body-painting-models) for your event.
