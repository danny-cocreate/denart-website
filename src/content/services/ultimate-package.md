## The Ultimate Self-Expression

Create a one-of-a-kind masterpiece in this full day of creative expression at our studio.

After you schedule your session, prior to the session, we work closely with you to design the custom original painting for you.

On the day of the shoot, you will have a team of body painter, make up artist and hair stylist who will work together to transform you into a masterpiece from head to toe. Then, our photographer will immortalize the image in a fun and liberating photography session.

Few days after the session, we will upload all images from the session to a private online gallery that is protected by a passcode. Basic retouching that consists of lighting and color adjustments will be applied to all images. From that gallery, you will choose your favorite image which we'll apply artistic retouching to and then print on a large canvas (24" x 36"). The final print will be mailed directly to you, ready to display.

## The Experience

Your day begins with a consultation where we'll discuss your vision, color preferences, and any themes or stories you want to tell through your body art. Our Master Painter will then create a custom design just for you.

On the day of your session, you'll be pampered with professional hair and makeup services before the body painting begins. The transformation takes several hours, during which you can relax, listen to music, and watch yourself become art.

After the painting is complete, we'll move into the photography phase. Our photographer will guide you through poses that showcase your unique artwork while making you feel comfortable and confident.

Within days, you'll receive access to your private gallery where you can select your favorite shot for the canvas print that will commemorate this unforgettable experience.
