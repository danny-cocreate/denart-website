## What Others Say

> "This was such a unique experience, a great way to appreciate art, and your own body. I was definitely nervous going into it, but both Danny and his assistant Julie were so friendly and personable that it was like chatting with pals……while you are getting this amazing work of art painted on you! Not totally confident in my own figure, yet the painting flattered my body and I got some great photos out of it. I highly recommend this experience, and will definitely consider doing this again in the future, or as a gift. Great confidence booster for all you women out there, do it!!!"

> "The body painting session I had at DenArt was absolutely amazing on every level. The painting was gorgeous and much to my surprise, done without any feeling of embarrassment at being naked lol! I had a picture that I wanted recreated and the result was simply outstanding. I can't say enough good things about the experience from start to finish and the photos they took at the end are just beautiful. Definitely something I would highly recommend and something I would do again."
