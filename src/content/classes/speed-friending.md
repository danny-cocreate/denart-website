## About this event

A different way to meet and connect with other singles through fast-paced interactive body painting activities designed to facilitate real connection.

## Why is this better than a traditional singles' event?

Typical singles' events puts pressure on you to be interesting by talking about yourself within few minutes. This is rarely effective, because in many cases, each person is concerned about looking and sounding good, instead of connecting with another person.

In these situations, you normally end up asking and answering the same superficial questions that don't define who you really are (i.e. "what do you do?", "how old are you?" etc.), which rarely lead to building a real connection.

Our approach focuses on creating a space for the attendees to play through the various mini activities involving body painting, sharing stories and lots of laughter. This brings out the real interesting person inside in a natural way. Our activities are designed to get the attendees to have fun and by doing so, bring out the attractive fun person inside.

## Who is this for?

Singles between 21 – 40. Although this event involves body painting, you don't have to be an artist to attend. Most attendees paint simple shapes or even use words. The focus of the activities is not on the finished paintings, but on the interaction during the painting activity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is nudity allowed?**
Not for this event. We support body positivity, but since many people come alone, we want to make sure everyone feels comfortable.

**What if somebody at the event makes me feel unsafe or uncomfortable?**
At any point, you can walk away from any interactions that make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Our staff will constantly walk around to monitor the interactions to ensure everyone's safety. They will be happy to interfere and remedy the situation if you don't feel comfortable doing so yourself.

**Do I need to have painting experience?**
No, absolutely not! Our interactive UV body painting experience is designed for all levels of experience and is meant to be a fun and creative way to express yourself.

**Can I come with a partner and paint only each other?**
No. This experience is designed to connect you with new people, not to deepen an established connection that you already have.
