## What People Say

> "This is definitely an intimate activity, excellent for couples, but make sure you are comfortable with other couples in the room! We were clearly instructed that we could go topless if we wanted, but not entirely nude and could of course remain clothed if we preferred. There was a table set with plenty of glowing paints and brushes for our creativity and the instructor offered to help with ideas. He was a wonderful artist himself and even painted one of the girl's back on request.… In the end, I was quite pleased with our creations, the only shame is that you have to eventually wash it all off!"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there an age limit to enter the event?

Because of the (partial) nudity involved in the event, you need to be at least 18 years old.

### What do I bring to the class?

We will provide the supplies for the class, so you don't need to bring anything. We do encourage participants to come with ideas for the design(s) that they'd like to paint on their partner or what they'd like to have painted on themselves.

### Can my friend come to the session?

Sorry, this is only for registered students. Having people who don't participate in the class could make some students feel uncomfortable.

### Do I have to be an artist or have some artistic skills?

No. Most people who come to this class don't consider themselves as artistic or would brag about their painting abilities. The focus of this class is to experiment with body painting and have fun: to play. Our professional artist will be able to provide any help that you may need (i.e. outlining the design for you to fill in).

### Can I request what will be painted on me?

Yes, you have the opportunity to decide (together with your partner) what you will paint and what will be painted on your body.

### Do I have to be nude for this class?

No, nudity is not required for this class. Many students prefer to be topless for the class. However, if you don't feel comfortable being topless, you can get the painting on your back and you can cover your front torso.

### What if I need to cancel or reschedule?

Our standard cancelation policy applies to this class. You can review it on our [Cancelation and rescheduling policy](/cancellation-and-reschedule-policy).
