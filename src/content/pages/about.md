## Our Story

DenArt studio is the first retail body painting studio in NY. We are the first company that makes the body painting experience available for the general public, where anyone can just come in and experience body painting then get photographed. Before we came into the picture, this kind of experience was only available for professional models as part of elaborate productions.

DenArt studio started when Danny Setiawan experimented with body painting as a medium to increase the relevancy of his art so he can make more impact through it.

**In 2009, Ekaterina Dorozhkina joined DenArt studio and turned it from a merely artistic endeavor into a business.**

DenArt studio exists to **empower through art**. We believe in the power of art to change lives for both the creators and the audience.

In addition to our passion in creating beautiful and engaging art to empower the public, DenArt studio aspires to inspire other artists to experiment with new ways to monetize their talents so they can create more art.

## Our Team

### Danny Setiawan
**Co-founder, Master Painter**

Danny Setiawan is an Indonesian born visual artist who combines traditional and digital media in his art.

Danny immigrated to the United States in 1997, and earned his Masters of Fine Arts degree in multimedia from Parsons School of Design in New York in 2003.

In many of his recent works, Danny uses human body as his canvas. Some of his creations, immediately recognizable replications of great paintings of the past, are tributes to his predecessors.

Danny's work has been featured on TV shows and magazines in the US, Europe and Asia.

### Lina Rozina
**Studio Manager, Body Painter**

Lina is a Russian-Born and Brooklyn-based visual artist who started painting around the same time she first started walking. A lifelong artist with an Illustration degree from Syracuse University and longterm experience in everything from fashion design & book illustration to art teaching, she became obsessed with exploring the extents and abilities of painting, first experimenting with changing surfaces and then venturing from the 2D form into the limitless 3D world.

In body painting Lina found the beauty of working with the curves of a breathing form, and the social reward of bringing art directly into someone's life, skin first. She loves to collaborate, experiment, and push creative boundaries, and she revels in the beauty and empowerment that body painting can bring into someone's life.
