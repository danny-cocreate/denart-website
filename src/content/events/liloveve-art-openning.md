These are videos from live body painting at Liloveve gallery art opening in Brooklyn, NY that we did in 2010.

Above is the official video by Meredith Kaufman Younger and below are the behind the scenes videos that we did (unedited).

For this event, Danny did live body painting on 2 models.

After he finished painting the 2 models, couple guests requested him to do body painting on them.
