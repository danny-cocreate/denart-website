## Howard Haber
> Spectacular! You and your models are both classy and amazing! So perfect! You definately made a few fans but I lead the pack. Just amazing. Thank you!

## Shallini M (Yelp)
> Danny is a very talented painter who painted two models at my husband's 40th Birthday party. He put a great deal of thought and care into the details. Everyone at the party loved watching him paint. Danny accomodated a special request of ours to paint a famous piece of art that he had not done before which came out amazing. He engaged the audience and made everyone feel comfortable – – he even painted on the arms of a few of our guests. If you want to make a party extra special, consider bringing in Danny – he is flexible and can suggest numerous ways to bring his painting into your party! Thanks Danny!
