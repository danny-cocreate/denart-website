				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"Danny is a very talented painter who painted two models at my husband's 40th Birthday party. He put a great deal of thought and care into the details. Everyone at the party loved watching him paint. Danny accommodated a special request of ours to paint a famous piece of art that he had not done before which came out amazing. He engaged the audience and made everyone feel comfortable – he even painted on the arms of a few of our guests. If you want to make a party extra special, consider bringing in Danny – he is flexible and can suggest numerous ways to bring his painting into your party! Thanks Danny!"</p>

				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"You simply must experience this!!! I picked the Persistence of Memory piece to be painted on my front and Gulya truly transformed me into a work of art. She was personable, skilled and did an incredible job with the painting…she knew just how to customize the original painting to my brown skin tone and body type. I was honored to be her canvas! And the photo shoot portion…what can I say…the pictures came out fantastic. She made me feel comfortable, gave great direction, had me try poses that complimented my body and features and took nearly 450 shots. It was easily one of the best things I have experienced and would do it again!"</p>

				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"AWESOME time for the ticklish…TOTALLY recommend this for anyone looking for something outrageous to do! I am a plus size woman and the dragon came out fierce. Those that I showed couldn't tell if it was my front or my backside. Danny was a pleasure to work with, and kept me at ease the entire time which I didn't think would be possible."</p>

				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"REALLY cool experience…I would recommend to anyone who is looking to just live and experience interesting things in life…you only live once so why not do interesting and fun things! I was very comfortable, nothing to be nervous or self conscious about…I am a photographer so I was able to contribute to the photo session as well, which was a lot of fun…stop hesitating and just go and do it, you won't be disappointed…"</p>

				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"Would recommend to anyone!! The session was a very empowering experience and even though you are nude in front of people you barely know I still felt very comfortable. Danny and his lovely wife took great care of me even when I became a bit dizzy. The artist who painted me was fantastic and let me take breaks when I needed to. I am so happy I did this and have the photos to remember this wonderful experience"</p>

				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"This was FANTASTIC! I bought this as a gift for my wife and we absolutely loved the experience. I was able to see her transformed into a work of art as a living canvas. Danny was excellent in doing the painting and the photography. It provided an excellent memory for my wife and I to share and the pictures look fantastic."</p>

				<p class="text-gray-300 italic">"This was the best time that I have ever had naked in front of strangers! The two artists were great, at no point was I uncomfortable, they both did excellent work, and the atmosphere was light and fun. I got Starry Night painted on my front and my BF got the Koi on his back. It was truly a great experience that we will repeat in the future."</p>
