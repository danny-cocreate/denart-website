        <p>Last year, few weeks before Halloween, I got a pleasant surprise when I checked my voice mail. It was from one of the producers for Last Call with Carson Daly on NBC.</p>
        <p>She found my site while browsing the web and was interested in doing a profile piece on me as a body painter for the show.</p>
        <p>We talked about how we'd do it, then she pitched the idea to her boss and Carson. They liked it.</p>
        <p>They came to my home studio, did an interview then documented my painting process. The piece was aired on Oct 31st, 2009.</p>
