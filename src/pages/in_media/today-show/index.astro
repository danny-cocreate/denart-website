        <p>The crew of NBC's Today show came to our studio to do a profile piece for their segment called "They get paid for that?" It's a segment where Sara Haines tries to do odd jobs for a day. This time she tries to see what it's like to be a body painter.</p>
        <p>Sara and the crew of TODAY show came to our studio to document one of our workshops and a photo shoot session.</p>
