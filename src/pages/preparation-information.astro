				<ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-300">
					<li>Please be sure to send us and/or discuss with us the design that you want prior to the session so we won't lose time deciding what we're going to paint when you come to the studio.</li>
					<li>Please eat something before you come and make sure you stay hydrated during the day.</li>
					<li>Please have your make up and hair done before the session so optimize the time for the photo shoot.</li>
					<li>Please bring clothing, accessories, and high heels that you'd wear for the shoot. In most cases, the shoes won't appear in the pictures but they would help with the posture when you pose.</li>
					<li>Please don't apply too much lotion in the area where you want us to paint because it will affect the way the paint interact with your skin.</li>
					<li>We use paints that are specifically made for skin application (brands: Ben Nye, Kryolan and Mehron). You can remove the paint by showering. Some colors might be more stubborn and require scrubbing. To facilitate removal, you can use rubbing alcohol, make up remover or baby wipes.</li>
					<li>Please bring hair bands if you have a long hair that might get in the way.</li>
					<li>You are more than welcome to bring a friend as long as s/he doesn't interfere with the creative process.</li>

					<li>Please eat something before you come and make sure you stay hydrated during the day.</li>
					<li>Please be prepared to do your own hair and make up since most likely we won't paint your face too much. We'll decide together what we're going to do as the painting takes shape.</li>
					<li>Please bring high heels, which would be helpful for improving the posture during the photo shoot.</li>
					<li>If you don't feel comfortable being in nude completely, you can keep your underwear on. We normally recommend full nudity because underwear disrupts the visual flow of the painting.</li>
					<li>If you plan to get painted in nude and you're getting your front side painted, please remove body hair for the parts of your body that will be covered with paint including chest and pubic hair.</li>
