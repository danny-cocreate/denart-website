				DenArt studio is the first retail body painting studio in NY. We are the first company that make the body painting experience available for the general public, where anyone can just come in and experience body painting then photographed. Before we came into the picture, this kind of experience was only available for professional models as part of elaborate productions.

			<p class="text-sand-muted mb-6">
				DenArt studio started when Danny Setiawan experimented with body painting as a medium to increase the relevancy of his art so he can make more impact through it.
			</p>
			
			<p class="text-sand-muted mb-6">
				In 2009, Ekaterina Dorozhkina joined DenArt studio and turned it from a merely artistic endeavor into a business.

				<p class="text-sand-muted text-left">
					Lina is a Russian-Born and Brooklyn-based visual artist who started painting around the same time she first started walking. A lifelong artist with an Illustration degree from Syracuse University and longterm experience in everything from fashion design & book illustration to art teaching, she became obsessed with exploring the extents and abilities of painting, first experimenting with changing surfaces and then venturing from the 2D form into the limitless 3D world.
				</p>
				<p class="text-sand-muted text-left mt-4">
					In body painting Lina found the beauty of working with the curves of a breathing form, and the social reward of bringing art directly into someone's life, skin first. She loves to collaborate, experiment, and push creative boundaries, and she revels in the beauty and empowerment that body painting can bring into someone's life.
