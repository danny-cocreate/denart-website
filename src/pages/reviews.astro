  { name: "Michelle, Google Places", quote: "You simply must experience this!!! Like the rater below… I saw this offer on Living Social… except that I didn't hesitate to grab it for even one second, and I am SO glad that I was able to experience this opportunity. I picked the Persistence of Memory piece to be painted on my front and Gulya truly transformed me into a work of art. She was personable, skilled and did an incredible job with the painting… she knew just how to customize the original painting to my brown skin tone and body type." },
  { name: "Nic, Google Places", quote: "AWESOME time for the ticklish… TOTALLY recommend this for anyone looking for something outrageous to do! Not something that I had ever thought about but when the offer came up on LivingSocial, I grabbed it! I am a plus size woman and the dragon came out fierce. Those that I showed couldn't tell if it was my front or my backside. Danny was a pleasure to work with, and kept me at ease the entire time." },
  { name: "Jennifer, Google Places", quote: "REALLY cool experience… I would recommend to anyone who is looking to just live and experience interesting things in life… you only live once so why not do interesting and fun things! I was very comfortable, nothing to be nervous or self conscious about… I am a photographer so I was able to contribute to the photo session as well, which was a lot of fun…" },

Danny and his partner were very thoughtful and collaborative." },
  { name: "Ashley C (Yelp)", quote: "Such a great experience that every one should try and a real ego booster. I chose a Asian inspired dragon on my back and couldn't believe how good and quickly it was done. Danny and his assistant were very nice and made sure I was comfortable every step along the way. Love how everything came out." },
  { name: "Anonymous (Groupon)", quote: "I purchased a groupon for a bodypainting experience at DenArt awhile back and found out i was pregnant shortly after. DenArt was kind enough to push back the expiration date just a bit so i could do the experience when I was 8months pregnant. We did the tree of life which was perfect." },
  { name: "Danny (Google)", quote: "Danny is excellent. I came with a friend today who wanted to get painted and try something new. He was very friendly, helpful and really comforting overall. My friend was a little nervous, but he was open, not creepy, and made the whole process so fun. I highly recommend this place." },
  { name: "Anonymous (Google)", quote: "What great fun this was! My gf and I had an hour session with Danny. I had butterfly wings painted on my back and flowers and dragon fly painted on my stomach- it turned out amazing. I loved the pictures taken as well! Highly recommended" },
